📐 MATLAB Programs 

📌 Overview

This repository contains a structured collection of MATLAB programs developed while learning MATLAB fundamentals and later applying them to modulation and demodulation techniques taught during my 3rd semester Communication Systems course. The focus of this repository is on simulation, visualization, and conceptual understanding of modulation schemes using MATLAB.

🧠 Learning Progression

I began by learning MATLAB basics such as variables, scripts, functions, loops, conditional statements, matrix operations, and plotting. These fundamentals enabled me to effectively use MATLAB as a computational and simulation tool for communication-related concepts.

After gaining familiarity with MATLAB programming, I applied it to simulate and analyze analog and digital modulation techniques, translating theoretical concepts into practical MATLAB implementations.

📡 Topics Covered

The programs in this repository include MATLAB-based simulations of the following:

📻 Analog Modulation Techniques

Amplitude Modulation (AM)

Amplitude Demodulation

Frequency Modulation (FM)

Frequency Demodulation

📡 Digital Modulation Techniques (Shift Keying)

Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

📈 Signal Analysis

Time-domain visualization of signals

Frequency-domain representation of modulated signals

Comparison of original and modulated waveforms

🛠️ Tools & Concepts Used

MATLAB scripting and functions

Signal generation and visualization

Modulation and demodulation simulation

Plotting in time and frequency domains

💡 Purpose of This Repository

Acts as a learning archive for MATLAB-based modulation techniques

Helps reinforce theoretical concepts through simulation

Serves as a reference for exam revision and practice

Demonstrates practical application of communication systems concepts

🚀 Future Scope

I plan to improve code readability, add comments explaining key steps, and expand this repository as I study additional communication and signal processing concepts in future semesters.

⭐ Note

All programs were written as part of academic coursework and self-practice focusing on conceptual clarity.
